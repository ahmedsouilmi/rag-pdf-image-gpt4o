This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built with FastAPI, LangChain, and OpenAI’s GPT-4o. It allows users to ask natural language questions based on two types of data:

• 📝 PDF documents — such as interior design briefs, proposals, or specifications  
• 🖼️ Interior design images — including room renders, furniture layouts, and floor plans

The backend uses LangChain for PDF chunking and semantic search, while GPT-4o handles both text-based Q&A and image interpretation. A lightweight Streamlit interface is included to test file uploads and queries easily.

Perfect for interior designers, architects, or product teams that need insights from both textual and visual design documentation.
